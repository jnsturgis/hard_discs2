* Need the BOOST library

* Force-field file is formatted this way
nbead                          // number of different beads
radius radius radius ...       // radius of each bead (one for each)
red green blue orange ...      // color of each bead (one for each), only red green blue orange at this moment
12 3                           // cutoff and length
-2.0  3.0  1.0 -1.0            // nbead*nbead matrix of interactions
 3.0 -6.0 -1.0  2.0            
 1.0 -1.0 -3.0  6.0
-1.0  2.0  6.0 -8.0

* Topology is formatted this way -- Currently 3 types, can add several of the same type
single                         // Topology type - here single
0                              // Bead type
square                         // Type again, a square object (4 sub atoms)
0 1 2 2                        // The types of the 4 sub atoms
triangle                       // A triangle, equilateral, with 3 beads
0 2 0                          // The type of each bead
