Things to fix and sort out the version on Github (in no particular order)...
1. Arrange for doxygen to produce decent documentation. (JS)
2. Improve error checking while reading files (issue #2 comment handling JPD).
3. Integrate non-rectangular areas without periodic conditions. (issue #1 JS)
4. Check command line handling is OK and all programmes work (before closing issue #6)
5. Include test suite (JS)
6. What goes to logfile? and perhaps control of verbosity (issue #5) (JS)
7. Forcefield from file (issue #4 - check resolved) (JS)
8. Topology from file (issue #3) (JS)
9. Use a makefile to build it all in the root directory...
10 I do not like the boost library!!!
