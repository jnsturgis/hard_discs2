Things to fix and sort out the version on Github (in no particular order)...
1. Arrange for doxygen to produce decent documentation. Now produces documentation needs to be improved (JS)
2. Improve error checking while reading files (issue #2 comment handling JPD).
3. Integrate non-rectangular areas without periodic conditions. (issue #1 JS)
4. Check command line handling is OK and all programmes work (before closing issue #6)
5. Include test suite (JS)
6. What goes to logfile? and perhaps control of verbosity (issue #5) (JS)
7. Forcefield from file (issue #4 - check resolved) (JS)
8. Topology from file (issue #3) (JS)
9. Use a makefile to build it all in the root directory... See below
10 I do not like the boost library!!!

===================================================

9. Recursive make of the suite, documentation and tests

Make in subfolders as necessary different possible targets.
	documentation	*** (DONE) just the documentation 
	install		*** install the binaries in a sensible place (~/bin)
	all		*** (DONE) binaries and documentation (default)
	clean		*** (DONE) remove most files
	dist-clean	*** remove even more files (including config)
	config		*** check dependencies etc
	test		*** run tests and produce report

Add documentation to makefiles...

====================================================

1. Documentation improvements with doxygen

First page with some nice stuff on it
The various programmes in the suite and their usage (User manual).
The different files and their formats. (Users manual).

Slowly getting there with markdown files carcass is there 'just' need
to flesh it out...

====================================================

makeconfig fails with unhelpful error messages, and now requires output file rather
than sending to stdout... also all parameters need to be named where previous version just took
list of object numbers. NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE new strange syntax.

Is this fixable? Make usage appear in the documentation...
POSIX recommendations...
1> No options EXCEPT -o outfile_name
2> required ordered parameters x_size y_size n_type1...

implementing this SHOULD only modify makeconfig.cpp is the problem with the use of boost libraries.

Branch: Fix_makeconfig
Try to include old style usage,
With optional parameters for forcefield and topology load from file or defaults.

====================================================
